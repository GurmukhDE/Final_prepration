# PART 2 — SPARK ENGINEERING HANDBOOK (50+ PAGE DEPTH)
=====================================================================
## 1. Spark Architecture Deep Dive
Spark uses a driver-executor model. The driver builds a DAG from transformations. Actions trigger job execution. Each job splits into stages separated by shuffle boundaries. Stages are divided into tasks mapped to partitions. Executors run tasks in parallel.

## 2. Memory Management Math
Total Executor Memory = Configured Memory - Overhead
Usable Execution Memory ≈ spark.memory.fraction × executor_memory
Default spark.memory.fraction = 0.6
If executor memory = 16GB:
Usable ≈ 16 × 0.6 = 9.6GB

## 3. Partition Sizing Formula
Optimal partition size = 128MB–256MB
If dataset = 3TB:
3TB = 3072GB
3072 / 0.128 ≈ 24,000 partitions

## 4. Shuffle Optimization
spark.sql.shuffle.partitions = data_size / target_partition_size
Enable AQE for automatic partition coalescing.

## 5. Skew Handling Techniques
- Salting keys
- Broadcast joins
- Split heavy keys
- Enable spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled

## 6. Exactly-Once Streaming
- Checkpointing
- Idempotent Delta merge
- Deduplication key
- Watermarking for late data

## 7. Delta Lake Internals
Delta maintains transaction log (_delta_log) with JSON commit files. Optimistic concurrency control prevents conflicting writes.

## 8. Small File Problem
Too many small files cause metadata overhead. Use OPTIMIZE and compaction strategy.

## 9. GC Tuning
- Use G1GC
- Increase executor memoryOverhead
- Avoid wide transformations where possible

## 10. Failure Scenarios
- Executor lost → recompute from lineage
- Driver failure → job restart
- Checkpoint corruption → restore from backup

## 11. Cost Optimization Strategy
- Auto-scaling clusters
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Optimize shuffle partitions

## 12. Security & Compliance
- Encryption at rest
- IAM role isolation
- Column-level masking
- Audit logging enabled

## 13. Cluster Sizing Example
If workload requires 200 cores:
Executor cores = 4
Executors needed = 200 / 4 = 50

## 14. Production Monitoring
- Spark UI stage analysis
- Ganglia / CloudWatch metrics
- SLA dashboards

## 15. Real Production Code Pattern (Merge Example)
```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
delta = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, '/delta/transactions')
delta.alias('t').merge(source_df.alias('s'), 't.id = s.id')\
 .whenMatchedUpdateAll()\
 .whenNotMatchedInsertAll()\
 .execute()
```
